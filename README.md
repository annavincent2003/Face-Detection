Project Overview
This face recognition system uses deep learning models to detect faces in images and videos, then identifies them by comparing the facial features to a pre-existing dataset. The system utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and OpenCV, along with Dlib or Face Recognition library, for face recognition tasks.

The project includes functionality for:

Detecting faces in images and video feeds.
Recognizing known faces from a dataset of images.
Providing real-time face recognition from a camera.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Identification and verification of faces.
Support for storing and loading user data (images of known faces).
Support for both image files and live webcam feed.
Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
Dlib/Face Recognition: For facial landmark detection and recognition.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For managing dataset (optional).
Matplotlib: For visualizing results (optional).

Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-project.git
cd face-recognition-project
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

opencv-python
dlib or face_recognition
numpy
pandas (optional)
matplotlib (optional)
4. Download pre-trained models (if required by the libraries you're using).
Usage

1. Face Detection:
To detect faces in an image, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python detect_faces.py --image <image_path>

2. Face Recognition:
To recognize faces using a live webcam feed, run:

bash
Copy
python recognize_faces.py
This will start the webcam and attempt to recognize any faces that are visible.

3. Adding Known Faces:
Before recognition, you need to add images of known faces to your dataset.

bash
Copy
python add_face.py --name <name> --image <image_path>
This command will store the face image and associate it with the provided name.

4. Identify a Face:
To identify a specific face in an image or webcam feed, run:

bash
Copy
python identify_face.py --image <image_path>

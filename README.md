Project Overview
This face recognition system uses deep learning models to detect faces in images and videos, then identifies them by comparing the facial features to a pre-existing dataset. The system utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and OpenCV, along with Dlib or Face Recognition library, for face recognition tasks.

The project includes functionality for:

Detecting faces in images and video feeds.
Recognizing known faces from a dataset of images.
Providing real-time face recognition from a camera.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Identification and verification of faces.
Support for storing and loading user data (images of known faces).
Support for both image files and live webcam feed.
Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
Dlib/Face Recognition: For facial landmark detection and recognition.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For managing dataset (optional).
Matplotlib: For visualizing results (optional).
